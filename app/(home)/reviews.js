I came back to Uganda to have all four of my wisdom teeth extracted and two molars filled which molars had been messed up by another dentist and kept on giving me issues .Dr.Mathew and his team were so patient with me throughout the whole procedure and kept on checking to make sure I was okay and had no pain, even through the healing process they called everyday to see how I was doing and scheduled follow ups. I can say that that has been the best dental experience I have ever had and I sure will get on that plane again to just come and have him work on my teeth again. Higly recommend for both adults and children , you will not regret it, absolutely amazing team .",
