        Conditions that damage your smile, such as tooth loss and gum disease, will adversely affect systems throughout your body. In fact, the more teeth a person is missing, the more likely they are to have additional health issues.<br />
        There are however a number of options. According to Dr Ashar Cheptoris, a dentist at Sinai Dental Clinic in Kamwokya, <em><b>dental bridges</b></em> are made up of one or several porcelain teeth attached to the neighbouring teeth.<br />
        They come in different types and their names depend on the method of attachment that binds them to the neighbouring teeth.`,

            Cheptoris Ashar, a dentist at Sinai Dental Practice in Kamwokya advises that just like your dentist recommends changing your <em><b>toothbrush</b></em> after every three months, it is equally healthy to clean the <em><b>toothbrush holder</b></em>.<br />
            “When you don’t change your toothbrush after three months, they do not only begin to attract germs but the holder where they are kept also begins to store germs,” Ashar explains, adding that cleaning your toothbrush holder should be a daily routine, just like brushing your teeth.<br />
            <em>Tips</em>: Clean the kitchen before the bathroom. The sink and shower should be cleaned before the toilet. Separate cleaning cloths for the kitchen, bathroom, the toilet and the bath/sink.`,
